———FUNCTIONS————

**LaplacianPyramid.m - the function creates a laplacian pryamid with "maxLevels" levels and 
blurs the levels with gaussian filter of size "filterSize"

**GaussianPyramid.m - the function creates a gaussian pryamid with "maxLevels" levels and 
%blurs the levels with gaussian filter of size "filterSize"

**LaplacianToImage.m -  creates an image from a Laplacian pyramid

**renderPyramid.m - the function receives a pyramid and number of levels
and render the image so the first level will be to the left
the next level will be aligned to upper edge to the right of the first 
image and so on, till level "levels"

**displayPyramid.m - The function uses renderPyramid to get a new image showing "levels" levels 
of the pyramid and displays it

*pyramidBlending -  The function recieves two images to blend, a mask (all of the same size)
and creates 2 laplacian pryamids from the image (with maxLevels, and 
filter size) and another gaussian pryamid from the mask.
then its creates a new lalpacian prymaid using those 3 pryamids 
and creates a new blended image out of it.

*Expand.m - this function take and image and a filter.blurs it, and then expands it size by 2.

*Reduce.m - this function take and image and a filter.blurs it, and then reduces it size by 2.

*linearStretch.m - the function gets an image, and does a linear stretch between 0 and 1
