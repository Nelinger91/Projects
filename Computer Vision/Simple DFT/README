**DFT - A function that receives a 1d vector and operates a Fourier transform on it
**IDFT - A function that receives a 1d vector in the Fourier space, and transform it back.
**DFT2 - A function that receives a 2d matrix, and transforms it to Fourier space.
**IDFT2 -  A function that receives a 2d matrix in Fourier space, and transforms it back.
**convDerivative - A function that receives an image, an derives it using convolution 
with the vectors [1,0,-1] and [1;0;-1]
**fourierDerivative - A function that receives an image, and derives it by
transforming the image to Fourier space, multiply it with the weighted function,
and returns it to the original vector space.
**blurInImageSpace - A function receiving an Image, and a size: describing the 
width and length of the gaussian kernel. it calculate the gaussian kernel,
and convolutes the Image with it, in order to receive a blurred image.
**blurInFourierSpace - Another function that blurâ€™s the picture. but it blurs the
image in the fourier space, and then uses IDFT2 to get the blurred image in the 
original space.
